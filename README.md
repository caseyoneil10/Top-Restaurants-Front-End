## Approach Taken

 1. Plan the project initially by making notes on what our page will look like, what our data set will be comprised of, and what the general functionality of the app will look like.
 2. Setup the backend schema and get our CRUD routes posting to the cloud server with the help of  Postman.
 3. Build out the front end by simply getting some of the data to display in our React front end. 
 4. Start adding additional functionality like sort, search, and Google Maps API.
 5. Add styling via a framework, and make the page responsive.
 6. Constant testing of app locally and also pushing to Heroku to ensure nothing breaking on our deployed version.

## Stretch Goals

 - Incorporate Google Maps API
 - Use a CSS Framework
 - Sort the data coming from the server numerically (by rank)
 - Search the data on the front end only display matching restaurants
 - Custom error messages for a failed schema validation

## Unsolved Problems

 - Uploading an Image instead of having to link to a URL
 - Storing Google Maps API key on the backend .env file

## Future Goals

 - User Authentication
 - Upload an Image instead of having to link a URL
 - A carousel for images
 - Sort by multiple things and have the user select which way to sort
 - Storing API keys on the backend .env file and accessing from frontend
